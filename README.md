# Time Tracking Demo

This app is a small front-end demo I built to show off my abilities.

I've tried to keep the UI simple and streamline the design by hiding the continue and delete buttons unless you're hovering over the row where they would display.

The backstory for this demo is that through the years I've had a very opinionated idea of how I like to track my time.  To reduce as much friction as possible while entering time. There is a text box where I type in what task I've started, and I calculate the durations automatically.
