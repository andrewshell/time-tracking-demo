# Time Tracking Demo

This app is a small front-end demo I've built to show off my react abilities.

Through the years I've had to track my time, either for work or for monitoring personal productivity. I've tried several tools and methods but haven't found anything I've liked. I need an application that reduces the friction to enter time but allows clear reporting in my own words.

I found that the best way to do this is to have a text box where I enter my task, then the app calculates duration for me. Sometimes I have to record any events I missed, so I allow changing the time when recording a task.

I will continue to work on this, building out the UI and adding my desired features. At some point, I'll attach a backend (FireBase?) and authentication, and it will be something I can use on a daily basis.
